# Results
## Newton-Raphson

After doing the Newton-Raphson modified with step and direction, the estimation of coefficients are:

## Coordinate-Wise

The range of $\lambda$ we tried is (3,0) with length 100. The initial guess of all $\beta$ including the intercept is 0.02. The Pearson-Chi square statistics(g.statistics), MSE, was introduced to compare the models. So in the 5-Fold Cross Validation. In each fold. Below is the results:

In all 5 folds, the optimal $\lambda$ is 0, with similar $\beta_s$ in each fold.
